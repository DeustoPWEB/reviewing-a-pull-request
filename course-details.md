This course will dive into how you can get your best work done by identifying when and how to request a review, how to perform a review for someone else's pull request, and other awesome collaboration methods.

All great projects start with collaboration. Pull requests are the foundation of teamwork on GitHub — and pull request reviews give you the ability to work together and discuss changes specific to a pull request by commenting, requesting changes, or approving.

## What you'll learn

We'll answer common questions like:
- What is a pull request?
- How do I request, review, or comment on a pull request?
- How do I accept changes introduced by a pull request review?
- What are the responsibilities of a reviewer?
- What's a CODEOWNERS file?
- What's a diff and how do I use it?
- How do I implement changes from a pull request review?
- How can I suggest a change when reviewing a pull request?

And when you're done you'll be able to:
- Create a pull request
- Comment on pull requests
- Leave reviews on pull requests
- Know what’s expected when reviewing pull requests
- Request pull request reviews
- Accept changes introduced by a pull request review


## What you'll build
