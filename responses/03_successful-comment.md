## Reviewing Pull Requests

Nice work @{{ user.username }}. By providing feedback, you've enabled me to reevaluate how I am making my desired change. But, pull request reviews don't stop at commenting. You can also `approve` or `request changes` on my pull request.

When you get asked to review something, you should acknowledge the request. Acknowledging a review request could take several forms. It could be leaving a comment on the pull request or leaving a review. In some cases, it could be rejecting the review request altogether.

<details><summary>Before you review, some things to consider</summary>

#### Discern the context

Review the title and body of the pull request to understand the intended change. This should help you identify limitations, boundaries, and other important context.

#### Observing the progress

As a reviewer, there are certain things to look for when identifying how to best provide feedback. In early stages, reviews should focus on the general direction of the changes. Identify if the goal is possible, rather than nitpicking the style, polish, or wording. Pull requests that are closer to merging should receive a robust review. Thorough testing is one of many ways to ensure the changes won't break the project.

Regardless of timing, focus your feedback on the most essential changes. Suggest changes for minor issues within the pull request. When suggesting major changes, open a separate pull request against the author's branch.
