# Congratulations! :tada:

Nice work helping me with all of these pull requests! As you continue working on repositories on GitHub remember that providing high quality reviews and helping your fellow collaborators ship :ship: changes will improve your project. If you are new to a repository, you should inquire about any review practices they have so you can hit the ground running. 

## New features ahoy!

GitHub is constantly adding new features to our platform, and pull requests aren't exempt from that! Be on the lookout for a new beta feature that enables you to apply suggested changes from the pull request. If you have write access to a repository you will be able to click the **Apply suggestion** button right from the **Conversation** tab of the pull request. The suggestion will be applied as a new commit on the pull request with the person who suggested the change as the author and you as the committer.
