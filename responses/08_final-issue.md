# Congratulations! :tada:

Nice work helping me with all of these pull requests! As you embark on your journey of making great software applications better everyday, you might want to keep [this article](https://githubber.com/article/crafts/engineering/how-to-review-a-pull-request#approving-a-pull-request) in your back-pocket. :jeans: It covers a lot of the stuff we covered in this course and provides some more tips and requirements for reviewing pull requests when working in repositories hosted in GitHub. If you have any questions along the way, make sure to ask you team (or the team you are helping) to answer any questions :question: as they come up.
