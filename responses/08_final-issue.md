# Congratulations! :tada:

Nice work helping me with all of these pull requests! As you continue working on repositories on GitHub remember that providing high quality reviews and helping your fellow collaborators ship :ship: changes will improve your project. If you are new to a repository, you should inquire about any review practices they have so you can hit the ground running.
