# Congratulations! :tada:

Nice work helping me with all these pull requests! As you continue working on GitHub, remember that high quality reviews improve quality. If you are new to a repository, inquire about what review practices they have so you can hit the ground running.

## New features ahoy!

![gracehoppertocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/gracehoppertocat.jpg)

GitHub is always adding new features to our platform, and many new features are for pull requests! Be on the lookout for a new beta feature that enables you to apply suggested changes from the pull request. If you have write access to a repository, you will find an **Apply suggestion** button in the **Conversation** tab of the pull request. The author can accept the suggestion as a new commit on the pull request. The person who suggested the change will be the author, and the person who accepted it is the committer.

For more information about this awesome new feature, check out this [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) article.
