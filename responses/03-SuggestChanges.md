Now that you know how to approve an awesome pull request, let's take a look at how to suggest changes to a pull request. 

As a reviewer, your role is to help the pull request author (that is me :smile):

- Make sure that code destined for production is of the highest quality
- Make sure that we have commented on and confirmed any intentional shortcuts (techdebt) being taken in the code
- Make yourself aware of potential risks associated with their changes

When you review a pull request, you are contributing to the momentum of the authorship process to ensure that the pull request doesn't stall out of become stale.

As a reviewer, your responsibilities include:

- Suggesting other reviewers to the author if you feel they are warranted
- Commenting on, approving, or requesting changes on the PR
- Providing suggestions for alternate or better implementation details
