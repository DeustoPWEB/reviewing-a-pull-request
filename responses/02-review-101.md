This is a pull request, unlike an issue where project contributors _discuss_ a bug or new feature, the pull request is where you can _share_ the changes being made to the repository. 

I've requested your review on this pull request, but don't be alarmed, I've just added your name to the `README.md` file, so you should be able to **approve** it with ease. 

Before reviewing this pull request, we should discuss how reviews work within GitHub. 

- Review requests are the most common way you will be request to review code
- After joining an engineering team, you should begin receiving _review requests_ from your team
- You might receive requests from other teams if the feature they are working on is inside your team's area of maintainership
- Our internal best practice is to acknowledge a review request within 1 business day by doing one of the following:
  - Leave a review
  - Leave a comment stating your intentions
  - Send the author a message in Slack
  - Reject the review request

Coworkers might ask you in passing via Slack or in the hall if you could "take a look at" or "glance at" their PR. Although that person should probably use the review request feature, they are conventionally asking for the same thing. As long as you feel comfortable reviewing the content, it's ok to collaborate and help that person out with a review. In effect, you have their consent and request to participate in the review process.

If you are in doubt about what type of code review your coworker is casually requesting, ask for clarification. You may also consider asking your coworker to formally request your review using the review request feature.
