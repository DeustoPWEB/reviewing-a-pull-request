This document is an attempt at creating the course in a different manner. The story and activities will be created in this document and parsed out to other files once it has received a general approval. Moving between files to track the flow of the course is annoying (to me) and having one stream of content just makes more sense for my brain. 

Layout of this file:

```
# New comment on issue or pr

Content inside said comment

## response (success or failure)

```

# Intro to course

- pull request

Hey there, I see you're new around here. As a member of the engineering team, you will be required to get and give pull request reviews before changes can be merged to production. This is important because it ensures the best :ok_hand: code makes it to production and maintains the momentum of changes to our products.
   
As you can see, I've just opened this pull request and requested a review from you. I haven't done much yet, but would you mind taking a quick look and adding comments.

Comments are used early in the review process when an explicit approval or request for changes is not yet warranted. They enable you to inquire about the proposed change, make suggestions to the author, and generally help your team make awesome things.

Not only can you ask questions or make suggestions to the proposed change via your sweet vocabulary, you can suggest changes directly to the code using the [```suggestion ``` feature](https://team.githubapp.com/posts/31384). 

### :keyboard: Activity: Add a comment to my pull request
   
- User adds a line comment: PR has a change to `file` with `reviews reviews reviews` "accidentally" entered (i.e. Intro to pull request reviews reviews reviews)

## Commented on pull request (success) 

Nice work @{{ user.username }}, by providing feedback on my pull request it enables me to make changes or reevaluate how I am making my desired change. Pull request reviews don't stop at commenting though, you can also `approve` or `request changes` on my pull request that will enable me (or prevent in the case of request changes) to merge my pull request!

I've made some changes to this branch and would love :heart: it if you could `approve` this pull request. For now, just approving the pull request will suffice, in a moment we will look at requesting changes :+1:.

## Approved pull request (success)

Thanks for approving my pull request! Now that my pull request is approved, I can merge it into our project. While I'm merging this in (I might have already :grinning:), why don't you head over to this new pull request I made. With you helping me out, I seem to be able to tackle anything! :muscle::muscle-right:

# Using requires changes on a pull request

Thanks again for all your help on that last PR. Since you are helping me out, I figured I would add some more changes to our project, with our powers combined _anything_ is possible! This last change I made doesn't seem to be working though. :grimacing: 

Sometimes when you are reviewing a pull request, the author might identify that some of the functionality isn't working and needs a helping hand :wave: to solve the problem, in other instances it might "work on their machine" and they won't be aware that it doesn't work. When reviewing a pull request, not only is it important to look :eyes: at the code, but actually testing the code in a `dev` environment can help pinpoint any bugs that you don't catch by just looking at the code. 

If you could check out this code for me and tell me what is wrong, that would be fantastic!

_instructions for using requires changes_ the broken code will be something easy to spot , alternatively, we can have them enable github pages and be able to use the preview pages option to identify the issue

## Requires changes (success)

Thanks for catching that bug :bug:. In my excitement to ship more stuff I must have made a type. I'm making a change to this branch to fix my mistake, once I've done that you can click **Approve changes**.
