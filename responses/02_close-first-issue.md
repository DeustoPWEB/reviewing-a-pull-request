Nice work, @{{ user.username }}! Assigning yourself to an issue is a great way to let people know what you are working on. Once you begin working on something though, it is important to get their thoughts on your work via pull request reviews. 

Go to the [pull request](link to new pr) that I just opened to try pull request reviews out.
