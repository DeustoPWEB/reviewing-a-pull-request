## Welcome!

Hello and welcome! In this course you will learn how you can get your best work done in pull requests.  You'll learn when and how to request a review, how to review someone else's code, and how to respond to reviews. To do this, we'll be playing around with the code in this repository that makes a simple Tetris game.

To deploy this Tetris game on GitHub Pages, go to the **Settings** tab of this repository. Scroll down to **GitHub Pages**. Select `master` as a **Source**, and click **Save**. GitHub will create a deployment for you on GitHub Pages.

## Pull Requests Reviews 101

Reviewing a pull request is an opportunity to examine another contributor's changes. While reviewing a pull request, you can extrapolate how someone else solved a problem. It's an awesome opportunity to learn more about how the code works and how others solve problems. Reviewing a pull request is a great learning opportunity!
