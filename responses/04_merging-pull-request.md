### What repositories require a peer review and approval in order to deploy?

At GitHub, most of the repositories that you work in will require an approved peer review prior to deployment. Not only do these repositories require peer reviews, but they use automated tests to ensure the code being shipped :ship: is as amazing as you are. :sparkles:

Additionally, some repositories use the [CODEOWNERS](https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/) feature in concert with the pull request approval process. If approval is required from a code owner, the code owner has the final authority to approve the pull request. Although providing your approval on a pull request with `CODEOWNERS` enabled won't enable the pull request to be merged, it does demonstrate additional _confidence_ in the change.
