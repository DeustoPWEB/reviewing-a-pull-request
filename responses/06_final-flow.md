# Requesting a reviewer

I've been working _really_ hard on this project, but I haven't let you show off your programming skills yet. I'd like you to make a change to our project to make it your own.  :+1: After you create your change and open a pull request, I would like to review it. The best way to get someone to review your pull request is to request for them to review it.

As a reviewer, I'm going to check to make sure the changes don't break anything. :construction: But, it's your job as the author to tell me what you are trying to do. By clarifying the goals in your first comment, I can start reviewing immediately. This allows us to work asynchronously, so I can continue being a night-owl and you can enjoy being the early bird. :owl: :bird:
