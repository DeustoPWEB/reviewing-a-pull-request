## Requesting changes

Thanks for making that suggestion on my change. In my excitement to ship more stuff, I must have gotten distracted while picking colors. :grimacing: I'm making a change to this branch to fix my mistake.

Not all the pull request reviews you perform in the future will decide the color of the blocks in our Tetris game. :smile:

Although you may want to leave short comments like: 👍, 👎🏽, awesome!, or no; these don't give the author much detail. Provide comments **like the following** to enable the author of the pull request to respond:

- This looks like it’ll be helpful to our users, but I’m not sure about the flow. I also have some concerns about the efficiency of these queries.
- Although this feature might be useful, do we have any data that identifies that our users need it?

While you were reading this, I made your suggested changes. If you could approve my pull request, that would be awesome!
